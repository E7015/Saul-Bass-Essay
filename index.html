<div class="intro-para">
<p>Saul Bass, idiosyncratic graphic designer and visionary Oscar-winning filmmaker, could indisputably be regarded as one of most accomplished and revered interdisciplinary creatives in the design sector. His implementation of kinetic typography and sophisticated hand-drawn illustrations revolutionised how audiences are introduced to a film and are transported into the essence of its world. Bass' mutinous approach to popular design systems during the 1950s was distinctively subversive to the commonplace over-embellished film poster designs and ushered in a revolutionary influx of illustrative film title sequences. I will be investigating the methods and processes behind how this avant-garde designer transcended the boundaries of design in cinema from the start of his career to his indelible influence on modern cinema today.</p>

    <div class="bass-portrait-container"><img src="images/bass-portrait.jpg" alt="Photograph of Saul Bass"></div>
    <div class="about-bass-para"><p>Before his transition into cinema, Saul Bass studied under multifaceted creative and New Bauhaus theorist, György Kepes, at Brookyln College. He ultimately introduced Bass to Bauhaus professor and cognoscente, László Moholy-Nagy and his Russian constructivist-inspired work, as well as his advocation for the implementation of technology into the arts, an ideology that Bass patently came to share. Bass' integration of the Bauhaus methodologies is equally evident, in his own words, “Design is thinking made visual,” (Bass, LinkedIn, 2024), which epitomises the ethos of functional design and is masterfully translated into his minimalist yet potently efficacious designs. However, it was some time before Bass actualised his experimental, utilitarian style and principles into the world of cinema as his career began in corporate advertising.</p></div>
     <div class="about-bass-para-2"><p>The Hollywood segment of his career, undeniably his most eminent, began in the early 1940s, designing studio print advertisements, including for “The Moon is Blue” (1953) by Otto Preminger. This gave rise to a distinctly successful relationship with Preminger who, impressed by Bass' poster design for his 1954 film, “Carmen Jones”, commissioned Bass to design the opening title sequence. This led to him being commissioned for a succession of projects, including Preminger's “The Man with the Golden Arm” (1955). In film journalist Ian Hayden Smith's words, “Bass garnered the attention and respect of the industry for his groundbreaking poster artwork and credit title designs for The Man with the Golden Arm.” (Smith, Selling the Movie: The Art of the Film Poster, page 120, 2018). This solidified Bass' role and status in cinema; however, his success cannot be restricted to the film industry alone, he has also designed some of the most iconic corporate identity logos such as Warner Communications' 1974 logo and Continental Airlines' 1968 “Jetstream” logo, “which have become some of the most recognized logos of the era.” (Art of the Title, n.d.).

        </div>
        </div>
        <div class="poster-para-1"><p>In the words of Ian Hayden Smith, “Nowhere throughout the 1950s was the relationship between a film and its artwork more pronounced than in the posters of Saul Bass.” (Smith, Selling the Movie: The Art of the Film Poster, page 109, 2018). Bass' posters could almost be classified as sui generis in nature, distinctively characterised by a superlative dichotomy of refined, sophisticated shapes forming a simple, dominant image, and rough hand-drawn elements. These paradoxical yet congruous designs are often composed of minimalistic geometric shapes, bold limited colour palettes, and an intrepid use of negative space against which his signature “paper-cut lettering styles” are juxtaposed, (Yin, Letterform Archive, 2018). His subversive imagery is thoroughly allegorical of each film's mood and ambiance, effectively, “distilling an entire story into one, singular image.” (Dvorak, Dwell, 2019).</p>
            <div class="poster-para-2"><p>Bass' poster design for “Vertigo” illustrates his skills in sublimation and minimalism as he extracted a single scene from the opening credits, transforming it into the “central theme of the film's artwork” and “perfectly distilled its themes,” down to a dynamic visualisation of the protagonist's spiralling descent into obsession, (Smith, Selling the Movie: The Art of the Film Poster, page 123, 2018). This revolutionary style of iconography has become synonymous with Bass and remains a popularised style in modern design.</p></div>
            <div class="poster-para-3"><p>At a time when the preponderance of film posters placed emphasis on the actors, Bass subverts from this entirely and instead utilises the victim as the focal point for Preminger's 1959 “Anatomy of a Murder”. As Amy Dvorak summarises, “His take on the 1959 courtroom drama draws parallels between the anatomy of the case and a human, symbolic of the myriad components: the characters, the legal system, ethics and morals.” (Dvorak, Dwell, 2019).</p></div>
            <div class="poster-para-4"><p>Although Bass is perhaps most well known for his work for psychological thrillers including “Vertigo” and “Psycho”, his skills span across and attune to the entire gamut of film genres. For example, Bass' artwork for Preminger's comedy-drama “Such Good Friends” (1971), featuring only a pair of legs, alludes to a comedy due to the organic, curved lines and thin, more elegant hand-lettering. Equally, Bass' adaptable skills resulted in the poster for Preminger's “The Man with the Golden Arm” (1955), a thrilling concoction of crime, drama and romance, in being regarded as one of the most timeless, ingenious posters to date.</p></div>
            <div class="poster-para-5"><p>Ultimately, Bass' posters, epitomised by Amy Dvorak, “helped define the visual culture of the 1950s.” (Dvorak, Dwell, 2019). His poster work is incontrovertibly ubiquitous in the cinema industry and remains an inspiration to modern day designers. Innumerable designers can attest to the unbounded inspiration Bass has provided through both his static and motion graphic work, such as revered graphic designer Paula Scher, “Saul Bass taught us that graphic design could be elevated to fine art,” evidencing how his work not only transcended the boundaries of design within cinema, but in other creative sectors as it infiltrated the art world. (Scher, LinkedIn, 2024).</p></div>

<div class="colour-block-red-4">
    <div class="title-sequences-subtitle"><h2>TITLE SEQUENCES</h2></div>
    <div class="title-sequence-opening-para"><p>Typography in motion was already an existing practice by the time Bass began his revolutionary experimentation, with evidence of early animated letterforms materialising from 1899 in advertisements by filmmaker Georges Méliès, utilising multiple exposures and time-lapse photography, (Carter, et al., Typographic Design: Form and Communication, page 156, 2018).</p></div>
    <div class="title-sequence-opening-para-2"><p>In modern cinema, typography in motion is an indispensable, paramount tool for a designer, and combined with a film's score and imagery, facilitates the designer with the means to potently convey the mood of the narrative in a non-descript, graphical manner. Bass' seminal impact on the title sequence stemmed from his philosophy; “Bass believed films should begin with the very first frame and that titles were…an “overture,” which set the mood and foreshadowed the story itself: its tone, themes and even ambiguous clues to how the film might be read.” (Hersey, Esquire, 2024). He transformed the possibilities of the static title sequence from a legal requirement to an innovative, expressive form of visual storytelling; effectively enthralling the audience within the story world with visually subtle clues as to the mood of the film and its narrative before it begins. Ultimately, Bass transcended the boundaries of design within cinema by metamorphosing it into an integral part of the overall storytelling experience and revolutionising the cinema experience for perpetuity.</p></div>
    <div class="title-sequence-column"><div class="golden-arm-title"><img src="images/the-man-with-the-golden-arm-title-sequence.jpg" alt="The Man with the Golden Arm opening film title sequence" style="width:1075px;"></div></div>
    <div class="title-sequences-para-1"><p>Bass procured his Hollywood reputation with the groundbreaking, unprecedented title sequence design for Preminger's “The Man with the Golden Arm” (1955), surpassing the boundaries of design within cinema for the first time and establishing a new role for the title sequence. Through his Hollywood inception “The Man with the Golden Arm” title, Bass substantiated that minimalist graphic language coalesced with a musical score alone can result in a dynamic visual experience. The score was written by acclaimed composer Elmer Berstein as one of the first jazz soundtracks created specifically for a motion picture. This riveting score grows progressively more manic and intense, matching the jarring movements of the white lines, both straight and off-kilter, which appear and disappear off-screen, oftentimes almost enveloping the text, generating a visual parallel between these graphical elements and the claustrophobic, trapped mindset of the protagonist, a drug addict who aspires to become a musician. These lines eventually morph into the visually arresting form of a jagged, baleful paper cut-out arm, evoking a sense of “the disjointed, jarring existence of the drug addict…it was an accurate and telling synthesis of the film…and with the addition of motion and sound it really came alive and set up the mood and texture of the film.” (Bass, Medium, 2015).</p></div>
    <div class="title-sequences-para-2"><p>This design composed of an achromatic colour palette, exacerbating the intensity of the sequence, alongside the simple, geometric shapes arranged in a complex choreography that fits around the text, “reflects the fundamental building blocks of what Bass did in almost all his titles…it reveals the bare-bones structure of what you need to master the art of a title sequence. I believe that film titles are intrinsically tied to the aura of a film.” (McCarty, The Criterion Collection, 2020). In Bass' own words, “The intent of this opening was to create a mood spare, gaunt, with a driving intensity... [that conveyed] the distortion and jaggedness, the disconnectedness and disjointedness of the addict's life the subject of the film,” (Bass, Art of the Title, 2011). Bass effectively succeeded in the challenge of visually translating the intensity and metaphorical disfigurement of the film without, as author Pat Kirkham puts it, “resorting to sensationalism,” (Kirkham, Art of the Title, 2011), while breaking the boundaries of the integral impact of design in cinema in the form of simple shapes and kinetic typography.</p></div>
    <div class="title-sequence-column"><div class="vertigo-title"><img src="images/vertigo-title-sequence.jpg" alt="Vertigo opening film title sequence" style="width: 1075px;"></div></div>
    <div class="title-sequences-para-3"><p>Bass first collaborated with adulated director Alfred Hitchcock for his 1958 psychological thriller “Vertigo”. Bass opens on a rather claustrophobic and intimate close-up of a woman's lips, shifting into an intensely ominous extreme close-up of her eye, raising a sense of vulnerability, from which hypnotic kinetic graphics emerge. These minimalistic spirographs, technically referred to as “Lissajous waves, were contributed by artist John Whitney, a pioneer of computer arts and a long-time animator at UPA, a commercial animation studio well-known for their modern aesthetic and experimental techniques.” (Radatz, Art of the Title, 2012). The minimalistic Lissajous waves communicated the multiplex of themes surrounding the human psyche that are exposed throughout the film, exacerbated through Bernard Hermann's haunting, poignant score. They emerge in a continuous series, swirling dizzyingly as the audience transverse through the woman's mind, mimicking the sensation of falling and hinting at conceptual narrative intricacies such as the psyche of the protagonist, the detective who suffers from acrophobia, which becomes emblematic of his obsession with the woman he is hired to follow and is now beguiled with.</p></div>
    <div class="title-sequences-para-4"><p>The sequence ends by exiting the eye, making for a cyclical structure which reinforces the ideology that Bass assumes the role of a storyteller. The success of this film substantiates how Bass effectively and dynamically preludes a film, setting a new paradigm for the title sequence that transcended conventional boundaries, transforming them into a part of the storytelling process itself. As filmmaker and motion designer Ben Radatz synopsises, “There is a threshold in art and design where a work can become so iconic as to transcend its own scope and become a symbol for its medium. Credit Bernard Herrmann's haunting score or Bass' odd synthesis of sensual Kim Novak closeups and spirographic imagery, but it's likely an alchemy of the three that makes the Vertigo titles an enduring classic.” (Radatz, Art of the Title, 2012).</p></div>
    <div class="title-sequence-column"><div class="psycho-title"><img src="images/psycho-title-sequence.png" alt="Psycho opening film title sequence" style="width: 1075px;"></div></div>
    <div class="title-sequences-para-5"><p>Following the innovational, paramount success of “The Man with the Golden Arm” and “Psycho”, Bass' repute in the cinema industry for proficiently breaking boundaries had burgeoned so precipitately that, “Hitchcock deployed him as a well-remunerated “visual consultant,” (Hersey, Esquire, 2024). Bass' work for Hitchcock's revered 1960 psychological thriller “Psycho” consisted of almost dismembered, kinetic typography and the draconian movement of the misaligned blocks in his signature constructivist, New Swiss style allude towards the vehemently minacious mood and narrative of the film, harkening back to his earlier work for The Man with the Golden Arm. The grey blocks which dissect the screen without intersecting, alongside the fragmented text, visually simulates both the antagonist's psychotic and volatile disposition as well as the physical movements of the knife as he repeatedly strikes his victim in the classic shower scene.</p></div>
    <div class="title-sequences-para-6"><p>Bass' design, coupled with Bernard Hermann's staccato, sonorously violent score effectively captures the tension and antagonism of the film, generating a “parallel visual tension to the film that tells the audience everything they need to know about the plot, without saying much of anything at all. He artfully sets the tone by asking the viewer to read between the lines -- quite literally -- but he also asks that we read into them.” (Radatz, Art of the Title, 2011). Bass' influence even extended into the film itself, evidenced in the revered shower scene as the “stylised fast cutting and abstract framing,” reproduces the mood of his title sequence design. (Hersey, Esquire, 2024).</p></div>

<div class="colour-block-red-5">
    <div class="conclusion-para"><p>In summary, Saul Bass is evidenced as one of the most innovative and revolutionary multifaceted designers, who undeniably redefined the role of the title sequence and upheld it as a form of efficacious storytelling. His implementation of and masterful, almost choreographic, direction of minimalist elements and revolutionary kinetic typography communicated complex themes of the film without giving away any real exposition. He completely transcended the boundaries of design within cinema, not only by subverting from popularised, embellished designs, but by practically transforming the title sequence with what is widely regarded as one of the most idiosyncratic and distinctive approaches to motion graphics.</p></div>
