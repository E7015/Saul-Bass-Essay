<p>Saul Bass, idiosyncratic graphic designer and visionary Oscar-winning filmmaker, could indisputably be regarded as one of most accomplished and revered interdisciplinary creatives in the design sector. His implementation of kinetic typography and sophisticated hand-drawn illustrations revolutionised how audiences are introduced to a film and are transported into the essence of its world. Bass' mutinous approach to popular design systems during the 1950s was distinctively subversive to the commonplace over-embellished film poster designs and ushered in a revolutionary influx of illustrative film title sequences. I will be investigating the methods and processes behind how this avant-garde designer transcended the boundaries of design in cinema from the start of his career to his indelible influence on modern cinema today.</p>

    <div class="bass-portrait-container"><img src="images/bass-portrait.jpg" alt="Photograph of Saul Bass"></div>
    <div class="about-bass-para"><p>Before his transition into cinema, Saul Bass studied under multifaceted creative and New Bauhaus theorist, György Kepes, at Brookyln College. He ultimately introduced Bass to Bauhaus professor and cognoscente, László Moholy-Nagy and his Russian constructivist-inspired work, as well as his advocation for the implementation of technology into the arts, an ideology that Bass patently came to share. Bass' integration of the Bauhaus methodologies is equally evident, in his own words, “Design is thinking made visual,” (Bass, LinkedIn, 2024), which epitomises the ethos of functional design and is masterfully translated into his minimalist yet potently efficacious designs. However, it was some time before Bass actualised his experimental, utilitarian style and principles into the world of cinema as his career began in corporate advertising.</p></div>
     <div class="about-bass-para-2"><p>The Hollywood segment of his career, undeniably his most eminent, began in the early 1940s, designing studio print advertisements, including for “The Moon is Blue” (1953) by Otto Preminger. This gave rise to a distinctly successful relationship with Preminger who, impressed by Bass' poster design for his 1954 film, “Carmen Jones”, commissioned Bass to design the opening title sequence. This led to him being commissioned for a succession of projects, including Preminger's “The Man with the Golden Arm” (1955). In film journalist Ian Hayden Smith's words, “Bass garnered the attention and respect of the industry for his groundbreaking poster artwork and credit title designs for The Man with the Golden Arm.” (Smith, Selling the Movie: The Art of the Film Poster, page 120, 2018). This solidified Bass' role and status in cinema; however, his success cannot be restricted to the film industry alone, he has also designed some of the most iconic corporate identity logos such as Warner Communications' 1974 logo and Continental Airlines' 1968 “Jetstream” logo, “which have become some of the most recognized logos of the era.” (Art of the Title, n.d.).

        </div>
        <div class="poster-para-1"><p>In the words of Ian Hayden Smith, “Nowhere throughout the 1950s was the relationship between a film and its artwork more pronounced than in the posters of Saul Bass.” (Smith, Selling the Movie: The Art of the Film Poster, page 109, 2018). Bass' posters could almost be classified as sui generis in nature, distinctively characterised by a superlative dichotomy of refined, sophisticated shapes forming a simple, dominant image, and rough hand-drawn elements. These paradoxical yet congruous designs are often composed of minimalistic geometric shapes, bold limited colour palettes, and an intrepid use of negative space against which his signature “paper-cut lettering styles” are juxtaposed, (Yin, Letterform Archive, 2018). His subversive imagery is thoroughly allegorical of each film's mood and ambiance, effectively, “distilling an entire story into one, singular image.” (Dvorak, Dwell, 2019).</p>
            <div class="poster-para-2"><p>Bass' poster design for “Vertigo” illustrates his skills in sublimation and minimalism as he extracted a single scene from the opening credits, transforming it into the “central theme of the film's artwork” and “perfectly distilled its themes,” down to a dynamic visualisation of the protagonist's spiralling descent into obsession, (Smith, Selling the Movie: The Art of the Film Poster, page 123, 2018). This revolutionary style of iconography has become synonymous with Bass and remains a popularised style in modern design.</p></div>
            <div class="poster-para-3"><p>At a time when the preponderance of film posters placed emphasis on the actors, Bass subverts from this entirely and instead utilises the victim as the focal point for Preminger's 1959 “Anatomy of a Murder”. As Amy Dvorak summarises, “His take on the 1959 courtroom drama draws parallels between the anatomy of the case and a human, symbolic of the myriad components: the characters, the legal system, ethics and morals.” (Dvorak, Dwell, 2019).</p></div>
            <div class="poster-para-4"><p>Although Bass is perhaps most well known for his work for psychological thrillers including “Vertigo” and “Psycho”, his skills span across and attune to the entire gamut of film genres. For example, Bass' artwork for Preminger's comedy-drama “Such Good Friends” (1971), featuring only a pair of legs, alludes to a comedy due to the organic, curved lines and thin, more elegant hand-lettering. Equally, Bass' adaptable skills resulted in the poster for Preminger's “The Man with the Golden Arm” (1955), a thrilling concoction of crime, drama and romance, in being regarded as one of the most timeless, ingenious posters to date.</p></div>
            <div class="poster-para-5"><p>Ultimately, Bass' posters, epitomised by Amy Dvorak, “helped define the visual culture of the 1950s.” (Dvorak, Dwell, 2019). His poster work is incontrovertibly ubiquitous in the cinema industry and remains an inspiration to modern day designers. Innumerable designers can attest to the unbounded inspiration Bass has provided through both his static and motion graphic work, such as revered graphic designer Paula Scher, “Saul Bass taught us that graphic design could be elevated to fine art,” evidencing how his work not only transcended the boundaries of design within cinema, but in other creative sectors as it infiltrated the art world. (Scher, LinkedIn, 2024).</p></div>
